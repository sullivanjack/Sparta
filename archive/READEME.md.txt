# Sparta International 
# A recreation of an old ass program for a bunch of old dudes. 

Dave will send you spreadsheet later but below are examples of the
assumptions we used and believe the program uses.  This assumes the players
net score per hole after handicap is applied. I already explained how we
applied / distributed the handicaps via phone.

Once Dave sends file we need you to replicate all this with the Apple
program if you can and see if daily money is correct.

Example of our Assumptions


10 players

.10 per hole

.50 per 9

1.00 total

Everyone plays everyone

One guy losses every hole


.90 (lost to 9 players) x 18 = 16.20

.50 x 9 = 4.50 x 2 = 9.00

1.00 x 9 players = 9.00

Total:  34.20

34.20/18 = 1.90 max loss per player with 10 total players


15 players

14 x .10 x 18 = 25.20

.50 x 14 = 7.00 x 2 = 14.00

1.00 x 14  = 14 for total

53.20/18  = 2.95 per hole max
